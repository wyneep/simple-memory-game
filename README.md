**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After noticing that the positioning of the buttons changed on the screen by shrinking the preview pane, I realized that playing the game on a smaller device wouldn’t look the same as it did on a larger device. So, one of the first questions I started thinking about was how do web developers adapt their code so that it can be viewed in a more accessible way on devices other than the typical laptop or desktop, such as a mobile device or an iPad? Is there a way to change the sizes of certain details or remove certain details to make a site look more appealing, without having to write up a separate set of html, css, and JavaScript code, to account for all of these changes? Also, what strategies do web developers use when designing sites? How do they go about structuring how to layout their projects or determine what API’s to use, so that it has all of the information they need, depending on the device they are aiming to build it for? Lastly, although a chrome browser may be compatible with the code produced, how do web developers make sure that their code is compatible with all older web browsers? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would love to experiment with adding additional features to improve the user experience. Since a key detail to improving user experience is to narrow down my target audience, I would make sure to identify a specific demographic. For example, if I decided to target a demographic of colorblind women, between the ages of 19-29, I would have to make sure the colors I use are accessible enough in my game. To choose the right colors, I would use a tool like ColorSafe, which provides accessible color palettes, and implement them into my style.css code, making sure to look into apps or products my target audience already uses so that I can get an idea of what colors work best. Since this game is about memory, I could implement several levels of the game, where the speed of the game would increase every time the user won a round. Every level, there would also be a different pattern to memorize and I could experiment with adding one more button every round, using different icons and symbols on the buttons instead of just having different colors, using a site like Font Awesome. At the end of the game, when they have lost, they would get a score as to how many rounds they completed, motivating them to continue. To ensure that my audience is satisfied with my game, I would also make sure to ask for their feedback at the end of the game.
